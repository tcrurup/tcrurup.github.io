                            Here I talk about what I am currently working on developing.  I do try to do a little bit of everything including games of all types including browser games, 2d and 3d games.  I also like to make animations using pixel art from
                            time to time as well as doing some 3d modeling.  You will find all kinds of musings about that along with just some general postings about life

                            <h1>Zero Player Game</h1>
                            This is a browser based "game" that I am working on and you can try out if you want.  There is nothing to do other than watch and see what happens on your iteration.  This was inspired by the game of life.
